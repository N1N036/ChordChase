# Chord Chase

Chord Chase is a game where players must fly in tandem with the other planes. Each plane has a pitch and together they make chord.
The player controls the red plane, aiming to maintain a harmonious altitude. 
The game indicates the level of harmony through the sky's color: a darker sky signifies more harmony, 
while a brighter sky indicates inharmony or turbulence. Your goal is to keep up with the other planes by staying in the harmonious streams. 

If you encounter turbulence, it will blow you back! So, stay in tune and conquer the sky!




## Controls

The game's controls are simple: 

* Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control the plane's altitude.
